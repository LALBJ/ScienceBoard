It's famous for growing faster than any computable function, making it non-computable and tightly linked to the limits of what machines can decide.\n\nFor a long time, the exact values of BB were only known for small n. It was well established that BB(4) = 13, but BB(5) remained a mystery for decades. Recent research has now shown that BB(5) = 4098, a huge leap that highlights just how explosively the function grows. This result not only advances our understanding of Turing machines but also deepens the connections between computation, logic, and undecidability.\n\n\\end{document}\n",
