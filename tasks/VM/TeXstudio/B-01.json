Lean programming primarily involves defining types and functions. This allows your focus to remain on the problem domain and manipulating its data, rather than the details of programming.\n\nThe Lean project was launched by Leonardo de Moura when he was at Microsoft Research in 2013. It is an open source project, hosted on GitHub. Lean 4 is the latest version. For installing Lean 4, please see Download. Information about the community of Lean users and the mathematical components library Mathlib can be found at the Lean Community website. The Lean FRO nonprofit was launched in August of 2023. Its mission is to tackle the challenges of scalability, usability, and proof automation in the Lean theorem prover.\n\n\\bibliographystyle{plain}\n\\bibliography{refs}\n\n\\end{document}\n",
